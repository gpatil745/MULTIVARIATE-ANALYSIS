#The population trends vary across years for both sexes and age categories.
#Generally, there is an increasing trend in population over the years for all age categories and sexes, although the rate of increase differs.
#Youth and adults typically have higher populations compared to children.
#Males tend to have slightly higher populations compared to females across all age categories and years.

#Insight: This visualization illustrates how the total population changes over the years (2022-2024) for each country, segmented by sex and age category. It provides insights into population dynamics, highlighting any significant trends or variations across different demographic groups and countries.
